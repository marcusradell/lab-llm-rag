# The Power of Design Patterns in Modern Software Development

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced developers.

## Categories of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
Handle object creation mechanisms:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns
Deal with object composition:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator

### Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects:
- Observer
- Strategy
- Command
- Iterator

## When to Use Design Patterns

Patterns should be applied judiciously:
- When you encounter a problem that the pattern solves
- When the benefits of using the pattern outweigh the added complexity
- When communication within the team would benefit from pattern terminology

Remember that design patterns are tools, not goals. The objective is to create maintainable, flexible codeâ€”not to use as many patterns as possible.
