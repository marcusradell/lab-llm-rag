# The Art of Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code. The cycle is simple:

1. Write a failing test
2. Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code while keeping the tests passing

## Benefits of TDD

- **Improved Design**: Writing tests first forces you to think about the interface before implementation
- **Better Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how your code should behave
- **Fewer Bugs**: Catching issues early in the development cycle
- **Confidence in Refactoring**: Tests provide a safety net when making changes

TDD might seem slower at first, but it often leads to higher quality code and fewer bugs in production, saving time in the long run.
