# Security Best Practices for Web Developers

Security should be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, not added as an afterthought. Here are critical practices to follow:

## 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

Never trust user input. Validate on both client and server sides, and sanitize data before using it in:
- Database queries (to prevent SQL injection)
- HTML output (to prevent XSS)
- Command execution (to prevent command injection)

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

- Implement strong password policies
- Use multi-factor authentication where possible
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use secure session management

## 3. Data Protection

- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Be careful with what you store (do you really need to keep that data?)
- Have a data breach response plan

## 4. Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies
- Use tools to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party packages
- Understand what code you're including in your application

## 5. Security Headers

Implement security headers like:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Content-Type-Options

Staying current with security best practices is an ongoing process. Resources like the OWASP Top 10 can help you focus on the most critical vulnerabilities.
