# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Explained

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the development stages.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

CI involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. Each integration is verified by automated builds and tests.

**Key Components:**
- Automated testing
- Version control
- Build automation
- Immediate feedback on failures

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD takes CI a step further by automatically deploying all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.

**Benefits:**
- Faster release cycles
- Reduced manual errors
- More frequent customer feedback
- Lower risk deployments

## Popular CI/CD Tools

- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
- Travis CI

Implementing CI/CD requires a cultural shift toward automation and shared responsibility for the delivery process, but the benefits in terms of productivity and software quality are substantial.
