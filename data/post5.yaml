# Getting Started with Docker for Developers

Docker has revolutionized how we develop, ship, and run applications. By containerizing your application, you ensure it works the same way everywhere.

## Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency**: "It works on my machine" becomes a problem of the past
- **Isolation**: Dependencies for different projects don't conflict
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines
- **Simplicity**: Easy to share development environments with teammates

## Basic Docker Commands

```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull node:16

# Run a container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app

# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t my-app:latest .

# List running containers
docker ps
```

## Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications

For applications with multiple services (like a web app, database, and cache), Docker Compose allows you to define and run all services with a single command.

Getting comfortable with Docker can significantly improve your development workflow and make deployment more reliable.
