# Clean Code Principles Every Developer Should Know

Clean code is not just about making your code look pretty; it's about creating maintainable, readable, and efficient software. Here are some key principles:

## 1. Meaningful Names

Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. A good name should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it's used.

## 2. Functions Should Do One Thing

Each function should have a single responsibility. This makes your code easier to test, understand, and maintain.

## 3. Comments Are a Last Resort

Good code should be self-documenting. If you need a comment to explain what your code does, consider refactoring it to make it clearer.

## 4. Error Handling

Don't ignore exceptions. Handle them appropriately and provide context about what went wrong.

By following these principles, you'll write code that's easier to maintain and collaborate on.
